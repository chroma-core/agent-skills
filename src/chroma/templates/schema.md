## Schema

Schema configures collections with single or multiple indexes

Imports needed for the examples show in this file
{{CODE:imports}}

## Basic Example

{{CODE:basic-example}}

## BM25 config

{{CODE:bm25}}

## SPLADE config

SPLADE is a very high performing sparse vector search index. It works extremely well and generally should be used over BM25 unless there are specific reasons otherwise.
